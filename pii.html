	<h1>Rolls Royce Phantom-II</h1>
	<div class="ab0">
		The Rolls-Royce Phantom II was the third and last of Rolls-Royce's 40/50 hp models, replacing the New Phantom in 1929. It used an improved version of the Phantom I engine in an all-new chassis. A "Continental" version, with a short wheelbase and stiffer springs, was offered.
		<P>The Phantom was built in Derby, England, and Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States. There were several differences in specification between the English and American Phantoms.</P>

		<p><b>Drivetrain</b></p>
		<P>The Phantom II used a refinement of the Phantom I's 7.7 L (7,668 cc or 467.9 cu in) pushrod-OHV straight-6 engine[1] with a new crossflow cylinder head.[2] Unlike on previous 40/50 hp models, the engine was bolted directly to the 4-speed manual transmission.</P>
		<p>Synchromesh was added on gears 3 and 4 in 1932 and on gear 2 in 1935.[4] Power was transmitted to the rear wheels using an open driveshaft, a hypoid bevel final drive, and Hotchkiss drive, replacing the torque tube from a remotely mounted gearbox used on earlier 40/50 hp models</p>

<div class="ab3">
	<p><b>chassis</b></p>
	<p>The chassis of the Phantom II was completely new. The front axle was mounted on semi-elliptical leaf springs as on earlier 40/50 hp models, but the rear axle was now also mounted on semi-elliptical springs instead of cantilever springs. This, along with the drivetrain changes, allowed the frame to be lower than before, improving the handling.[1][3] The 4-wheel servo-assisted brakes from the Phantom I were continued, and the Bijur centralized lubrication system from the Springfield-built Phantom I was included on all Phantom II chassis.</p>
