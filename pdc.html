	<h1>Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé</h1>
	<div class="ab0">
		<p>The Rolls-Royce Phantom Drophead Coupé is a luxury grand tourer manufactured by Rolls-Royce that debuted at the 2007 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, Michigan, on 7 January 2007.[1] It is based on the 2003 Rolls-Royce Phantom and has styling heavily derived from the 100EX, a concept car shown to celebrate the company's centennial in 2004. In 2015 it was the most expensive Rolls-Royce model at $533,000. Several Drophead Coupés were used in the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony.</p>

		<p>The exterior resembles that of the 100EX. The 2-door 4-seat convertible has rearward opening coach doors and a two-tone colour scheme that distinguishes between the upper and lower bodywork and frames the teak wood panelling of the convertible's tonneau cover. However, it eschews the EX's aluminium bonnet in favour of more easily maintained stainless steel.</p><p>The front fascia resembles that of the 100EX but its middle bodywork/raised bonnet/grille assemblage stops midway down rather than continuing downwards and bisecting the front bumper</p>

	<p>Final assembly, including all body, paint, wood, and leather work, is completed to each customer's individual specification at the Rolls-Royce plant in Goodwood, West Sussex. The plant is close to the historic Goodwood Motor Racing Circuit.</p>
