	<div class="ab0">
		<p>The Rolls-Royce Phantom VI is a high end British car made from 1968 to 1990 by Rolls Royce. A total of 374 Phantom VIs were made, of which less than ten percent were manufactured in the last decade of production</p>
		<P>Most of the coachwork was created by Mulliner Park Ward, usually in limousine form, although a few landaulets were made</P>

	<div class="ab2">
		<p>The Phantom VI was the last Rolls-Royce with a separate chassis. It featured coil springs in front, leaf springs and live axle in rear, and drum brakes on all four wheels. The car was powered by a 6,230 cc (380 cu in) 90-degree V8 with a bore of 104 mm (4.1 in) and stroke of 91.5 mm (3.60 in) with twin SU carburettors, coupled to a 4-speed automatic gearbox.</p>
		<p>In a 1979 upgrade the engine capacity was increased to 6,750 cc (412 cu in), a 3-speed automatic gearbox with torque converter was substituted, and separate front and rear air conditioning units were provided.</p>
