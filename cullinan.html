The Cullinan is the first SUV to be launched by the Rolls-Royce marque, and is also the brand's first all-wheel drive vehicle. It is named after the Cullinan Diamond, the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever discovered.
		<p>The Cullinan sits above the Ghost and below the Phantom in Rolls-Royce's line-up,[4] with a starting price in the United States of approximately $325,000 (£255,000). It was unveiled in May 2018 at the Concorso d'Eleganza Villa d'Este</p>

			<p><b>Development</b></p>
			<p>t was long rumoured that the car company would venture into making an SUV. Auto Express exclusively reported that a design was in the works and correctly that the name would be Cullinan.This was due to its competitors such as Bentley and Lamborghini venturing into the SUV business with the Bentayga and the Urus respectively. On 17 September 2015, it was confirmed by Rolls-Royce design chief Giles Taylor that the company was tinkering on it. At the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show, Rolls Royce's CEO Torsten Müller-Ötvös said that the SUV will be revealed in 2018 and be on the market in 2019.</p>
