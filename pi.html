	<h1>Rolls Royce Phantom-I</h1>
	<div class="ab0">
		The Rolls-Royce Phantom was Rolls-Royce's replacement for the original Silver Ghost. Introduced as the 'New Phantom' in 1925, the Phantom had a larger engine than the Silver Ghost and used pushrod-operated overhead valves instead of the Silver Ghost's side valves.
		<P>The Phantom was built in Derby, England, and Springfield, Massachusetts, in the United States. There were several differences in specification between the English and American Phantoms.</P>
	</div><div class="ab1">
	<div class="ab2">
		<P>The Phantom was replaced by the Phantom II in 1929. The designation Phantom I was never used by Rolls-Royce; it is a construct of enthusiasts applied to help distinguish it from other generations with the same model name.</P>
		<p>Introduced in 1925, the New Phantom was Rolls-Royce's second 40/50 hp model. To differentiate between the 40/50 hp models, Rolls-Royce named the new model "New Phantom" and renamed the old model "Silver Ghost" [Incorrect, just like the so-called 'Gullwing' Mercedes-Benz, the company never referred to the first 40/50 hp model as the 'Silver Ghost'; this only came about later on account of the relative fame that the 'Silver Ghost' motorcar, AX201, chassis number 60551, received][citation needed][original research?], which was the name given to their demonstration example, Registration No. AX201.[1] When the New Phantom was replaced by another 40/50 hp model in 1929, the replacement was named Phantom II and the New Phantom was renamed Phantom I.[2]</p>

	<p><b>Drivetrain</b></p>
	<p>One major improvement over the Silver Ghost was the new pushrod-OHV straight-6 engine.[2][3] Constructed as two groups of three cylinders with a single detachable head,[2] the engine was described by Rolls-Royce as producing "sufficient" power</p><p>The engine used a 4¼ in (107.9 mm) bore and undersquare 5½ in (139.7 mm) stroke for a total of 7.7 L (7,668 cc (467.9 cu in)) of displacement. In 1928, the cylinder heads were upgraded from cast iron to aluminium; this caused corrosion problems. The separate gearbox connected through a rubberised fabric flexible coupling to the clutch and through a torque tube enclosed drive to the differential at rear, as in the Silver Ghost.</p>
